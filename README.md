# flutter_portfolio

My dev portfolio. Made using Flutter Web.

# Setup
You can use this for your own portfolio website by modifying this directory:
- `assets/data/*.json` - the json files contain all the data you see in the website
- The preview link for a project is optional.
- The images property in the json files point to `assets/images/` but you can specify your own asset paths.

# Dependencies
There are no libraries used in this flutter project. You can run it directly with the latest version of flutter.
